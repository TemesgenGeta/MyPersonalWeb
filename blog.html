                contact was lost. All 157 people aboard were killed, <br> representing
                a staggering 35 countries. Here is a timeline of how the day <br>

                    Ethiopia is still a relatively unexplored country when it comes to tourists, <br>
                    but those who decide to venture out will be rewarded with archaeologic discoveries <br>
