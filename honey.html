                    Honey is a great alternative to refined sugar which is merely a source <br>
                    of empty calories and generally bad for your overall health. Honey on <br>
                    the other hand is a lovely ingredient produced by nature and can not <br>
                    only sweeten your life but it also has abundance in minerals, nutrients <br>
                    and living enzymes.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are a lot of differences between real and fake honey that can be <br>
                    identified using only the naked eye by examining its physical properties. <br>
                    Real honey is thick and trickles only into a stream. It has a soft texture <br>
                    that will never separate into layers and offers a uniquely sweet aroma.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real raw honey, which is honey in its purest form, often leaves a slight <br>
                    tingling feeling or a mild burning sensation in your throat when taken. <br>
                    But in order to enjoy the benefits of honey, you have to make sure that <br>
                    it is the real and pure kind before buying it. The main problem associated <br>
                    with honey is finding the best quality in supermarkets. It is quite a <br>
                    challenge to find high-quality, pure honey.

                Many companies easily cheat people into thinking their commercial honey <br>
                mixed with glucose solution, high fructose corn syrup and other <br>
                ingredients is the real thing. Oft times when you open a jar of honey <br>
                and hear a little pop sound, it could signal that the honey has been <br>
                tampered with and a fermentation process may have taken place within. <br>
                The greatest quality of honey comes straight from honey bees and not <br>
                commercial factories therefore reading the ingredients label would be <br>
                a wise decision.
              </p>
              <p>
                Words such as raw, natural, forest honey or organic indicate that the <br>
                honey might be pure. But, because food regulations are usually biased <br>
                towards commercial entities, one can never be too sure and this may not <br>
                be a foolproof way to check. Here are some easy methods to help you exam <br>
                the purity of the honey you purchased.
              </p>
              <h3>1. Thumb Exam</h3>
              <p>
                Place a little amount of honey on your thumb and check if it spills or <br>
                spreads around like any other liquid. If it does, most times it is an <br>
                indication of fake honey. Real honey is thick while fake honey is runny. <br>
                Real honey sticks to the surface it is applied to and does not just drip <br>
                away. Furthermore, the taste of fake honey may remain due to the sugar <br>
                that was added. 
              </p>
              <h3>2. Water Exam</h3>
              <p>
                Place a teaspoon of honey in a glass of water and watch the reaction. <br>
                Fake or mixed honey will dissolve in the water while real honey which <br>
                has a more solid texture will settle right at the bottom of the glass as <br>
                lumps.
              </p>
              <h3>3. Paper Exam</h3>
              <p>
                Place a teaspoon of honey in blotting paper or a white cloth. If you <br>
                pour real honey on the two, it will not get absorbed or leave stains.
              </p>
              <h3>4. Fire Exam</h3>
              <p>
                Real raw honey is flammable, therefore proceed with caution. Take a dry <br>
                matchstick and dip it in honey. Strike the matchstick alongside the <br>
                matchbox. If it lights, your honey is real. On the other hand, if it <br>
                does not light, it was probably mixed and may also have some amount of <br>
                moisture added during contamination.
              </p>
              <h3>5. Vinegar Exam</h3>
              <p>
                Mix a tablespoon of honey with a little water and two drops of vinegar. <br>
                If this mixture foams up then there is a strong chance that the honey in <br>
                question was mixed or fake.
              </p>
              <h3>6. Heta Exam</h3>
              <p>
                When applying heat to real raw honey, it will caramelize quickly and not <br>
                create a foamy look. Fake honey on the other hand will not caramelize and <br>
                will turn bubbly.
              </p>
