                    A wedding is almost always a huge affair, but when it comes to Ethiopian weddings, <br>
                    the magnitude of importance increases exponentially. A wedding is a moment of a <br>
                    lifetime that should be treasured forever hence it should go as smoothly as is <br>
                    practically possible.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Ethiopian wedding tradition and culture is one of the richest in the African <br>
                    continent and has mostly remained unblemished over the years. As such, the <br>
                    Ethiopian wedding ceremony is a beautiful sight to see. Ethiopian weddings are a <br>
                    vibrant affair, thanks to the rich Ethiopia wedding traditions. Even though some <br>
                    couples are choosing to have modern weddings, most still incorporate traditional <br>
                    customs in their Ethiopian wedding ceremonies.

                <h3>Basic Procedures of The Wedding</h3>
                <h4>1. Telosh</h4>
                <p>
                    Telosh is a formal procedure which is undertaken 2 days before the main wedding. <br>
                    This ceremony is held at the bride’s parents’ home (or her house) and is <br>
                    characteristically celebrated by the bride and groom and their families. <br>
                    The groom and his family offer presents to the bride, these gifts usually include <br>
                    a wedding gown and jewelry. The presenting of gifts comes with a round of applause <br>
                    from the guests seated close by. After this is done, the rest of the guests present <br>
                    their gifts to the bride.
                </p>
                <h4>2. Groom's Arrival</h4>
                <p>
                    The arrival of the groom is an integral part of the Ethiopian wedding ceremony. On <br>
                    the morning of the wedding, the groom prepares himself at home in the company of his <br>
                    groomsmen. In the meantime, the bridesmaids get together at the bride’s family home, <br>
                    whereupon the bride starts to ready herself.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Upon the arrival of the groom and his entourage to the bride’s home, they find <br>
                    everyone, including the bride, ready and waiting. Those inside the bride's house go <br>
                    outside singing a traditional song that says they will not let anyone in the house. <br>
                    The mood is joyous and fun, as the groom begs the people to let him in to his bride <br>
                    to be. After a short back and forth with song, the groom is let into the house, where <br>
                    he presents his bride to be with flowers. She accepts this gift with a hug and a kiss <br>
                    and then everyone leaves to their awaiting vehicles and heads to the next Ethiopian <br>
                    wedding ceremony.
                </p>
                <h4>3. Joy Ride and Parks</h4>
                <p>
                    While en route to the next ceremonial point, the wedding photographers take videos <br> and
                    photos of the vehicular procession, which is also joyous and celebratory. With <br> the bridal 
                    car at the head of the procession, all vehicles have customary flowers <br> hanging out of the 
                    windows with the passengers all singing traditional Ethiopian <br> wedding songs. They all head 
                    to a beautiful garden park, where photo and video <br> shoots continue for about an hour.
                </p>
                <h4>4. Kissing of the Knee</h4>
                <p>
                    Following the photo shoot at the park, the kissing of the knee ceremony follows. All <br> guests
                    await the vehicular procession at the main hall where the wedding is held. At <br> the entrance 
                    to the hall, seated and waiting are the great grandparents and grandparents <br> dressed in 
                    traditional clothes. The groom and bride proceed to thank them and bow low <br> to kiss their feet, 
                    upon which they are given blessings for prosperity and health. The <br> parents may also be a part 
                    of this ceremony if so desired. The groom and bride then <br> continue by entering the hall or venue.
                </p>
                <h4>5. Wedding Lunch</h4>
                <p>
                    The next step is to have the main Ethiopian wedding lunch. As they enter the hall, the <br> flower
                    girls, candle girls, groomsmen and bridesmaids lead them in while singing <br> traditional Ethiopian 
                    wedding songs. The flower girls are at the head of the procession <br> dropping beautifully colorful 
                    flower petals for the couple to walk on. After a meet and <br> greet with the guests, the couple 
                    proceeds to be seated at their place of honor. Cultural <br> music of merriment fills the hall as 
                    everyone rejoices. At this point the priest prays for <br> the lunch to be eaten as the couple goes 
                    to the buffet area and is the first to be served. <br> They are followed by the bridal party and then 
                    the guests.
                </p>
                <h4>6. Official Engagement</h4>
                <p>
                    The official engagement and eating of the cake follows next. Oddly enough, the real <br> engagement 
                    takes place on the actual day of the Ethiopian wedding. After everyone has <br> had enough to eat 
                    from the wedding lunch, the couple goes on to section of the hall <br> allocated for the cutting of 
                    the cake and engagement ceremony. The ceremony begins <br> by the couple exchanging rings and cutting 
                    the cake, upon which time the champagne is <br> opened. The guests are all served a piece of cake and 
                    a glass of champagne, while the <br> bride throws gift parcels filled with sweets to the guests.  
                    The bride and groom then return <br> to their seats of honor.
                </p>
                <h4>7. Reading of Names</h4>
                <p>
                    Next up in the traditional Ethiopian wedding ceremony is the reading of the names. The <br> couple
                    proceeds to take pictures with each one of their guests and then is led to the stage <br> for their 
                    first dance as a married couple. Upon dancing for a short while amidst cameras <br> flashing, the couple 
                    is joined by family and guests. At this juncture, the band receives <br> appreciatory messages from 
                    family and friends not in attendance from all over the world. <br> The band calls out the names of the 
                    people unable to attend and passes on their well wishes <br> to the couple.
                </p>
                <h4>8. Dinner at Grooms</h4>
                <p>
                    The dinner at the groom’s family’s home follows next in the celebration. After the merriment <br> at the 
                    hall comes to an end, the newlyweds head to the groom’s family’s home. The groom’s <br> parents host this
                    dinner for close family and friends to relax after a long day. The evening is <br> spent discussing the many 
                    aspects of the wedding that took place amidst laughter and joy.
                </p>
                <h4>9. Melse</h4>
                <p>
                    The Ethiopian wedding continues even on to the next day, in the form of Melse. On this day, <br> the newlyweds
                    are clothed in traditional Ethiopian clothes known as Kaba. The parents of the <br> couple have allocated a 
                    place for the Melse or post wedding party. This evening event is once <br> again only for close family and 
                    friends and involves giving the bride a nickname and the cutting <br> of bread. As the bread is being cut, the 
                    bride’s mother presents her daughter a nickname that <br> everyone in attendance will use in remembrance of 
                    the wedding.
                </p>
                <h4>10. Kelekel</h4>
                <p>
                    By the third day, a Kelekel (mixing together) is held for all those extended family members <br> that were 
                    unable to be in attendance for the wedding. The parents of the newlyweds agree <br> on the location where 
                    this will be held. Towards the end of this ceremony, the parents bless <br> and congratulate their kids and 
                    bid them adieu. This event is also considered important for <br> those family members to meet and mingle for <br>
                    the last time till the next wedding.
