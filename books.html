                    I am interested to read different books. The books I read usually are <br>
                    religious and academic books. I try to read more spiritual books as <br>
                    much as possible in addition to academic books. <br>
                    I study academic books to know more about what is expected from the <br>
                    course. I am  rare for video lectures. Video lectures are boring for me, <br>
                    so I do not use them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I do not like to read books with hardcopy this time. I only use with <br> softcopy. At primary,
                    secondary, and preparatory school, I read books <br> with hardcopy. But after I join university
                    since there is no hardcopy, <br> Reading softcopy becomes my trend. Therefore I ignore hardcopies.
                </p>

                    I often focus on programming and technological academic books <br> such as python, android 
                    java, c++, csharp, web, networking books. <br> I select more simple and understandable religious
                    books.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Some of the books that I have read are prepared well and some other <br> books are not satisfactory.
                    Let me invite you some of books that I have <br> used.

                I would like to advise you to focus on books that are useful for your <br> life and school. 
                you should be selective.
