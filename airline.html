                    An Ethiopian Airlines plane bound for Kenya has crashed with 149 passengers <br>
                    and eight crew members on board. An Ethiopian Airlines spokesman confirmed <br>
                    the Boeing 737 plane had crashed at 8:44am on Sunday. The Ethiopian prime <br>
                    minister's office said the plane had crashed on a regularly scheduled flight <br>
                    to Nairobi after taking off from Ethiopia's capital, Addis Ababa. <br>
                    The state-owned Ethiopian Airlines calls itself Africa's largest carrier and <br>
                    has ambitions of becoming the gateway to the continent. In a statement, the <br>
                    airline said that search and rescue operations were under way near the crash site <br>
                    around the town of Bishoftu.

                    The airline flies to many destinations in Africa, making it a popular carrier in a <br>
                    continent where many airlines fly only from their home country to destinations outside <br>
                    Africa. It has a good reputation for safety, although in 2010 one of the company's aeroplanes <br>
                    crashed in the Mediterranean Sea shortly after leaving Beirut.
