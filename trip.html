                    Ethiopia is still a relatively unexplored country when it comes to tourists, <br>
                    but those who decide to venture out will be rewarded with archaeologic disco- <br>
                    veries millions of year's old, breathtaking natural scenery, and a rich culture.
                </p>
                <h3>1. Bird Watching</h3>
                <p>
                    With almost 900 bird species, the country is one not to miss, even if you've <br>
                    never bird watched before. From September to February will be your best time <br>
                    to go, though between November and February, you'll be able to see some migrant <br>
                    birds you may not otherwise spot. To take full advantage, try watching at the <br>
                    Highland Plateau, the Lakes Region, and/or the Lowlands. If you select the Highland, <br>
                    you'll find over 60% of species are endemic! Little spots of forest on the edges <br>
                    of the gorge can yield the best results, along with hilltops and areas near churches.

                As the altitude and climate change, so does the distribution of birds. The Simien <br> Mountain
                hold the Lammergeyer and Bone Breaker, and in Borena you can find the <br> Ethiopian Bush Crow 
                and Prince Ruspli's Turaco which can only be found here. <br> No matter where you head, though,
                you'll wish you'd done it sooner. This relaxing <br> experience is the perfect contrast to the
                more intense tours you may find at tourist <br> hotspots.
               </p>
               <h3>2. Golfing</h3>
               <p>
                Golf isn't one of the most popular sports in Ethiopia, but if you're big into the sport <br> and
                want to take your skills abroad, the country has a couple great courses. One is <br> located in 
                the capital of Addis Ababa with 9 holes, and there's a 6-hole alternative <br> at the British embassy.
               </p>
               <p>
                Though golf used to be widely seen as solely a sport for the elite, native Ethiopian <br> and pro  golfer, 
                Haile Ghebreegziabher, has helped to change that. With such a large <br> amount of land available, it's 
                the perfect place to expand and add in even more courses. <br> You can expect near-silence here, letting 
                you take in a great golf game and let some <br> stress melt away.
                
               </p>
               <h3>3. Biking</h3>
               <p>
                Being one of the safest countries in Africa along with a dry, generally warm climate, <br> Ethiopia is a
                wonderful destination for biking. It's ideal to go in groups of at least 8 <br> and with a guide, but no 
                matter where you'll go you'll feel your legs burning and be <br> able to take in some captivating vistas.
               </p>
               <p>
                The 10-day route can be filled with rugged terrain, while other parts are clearly marked <br> and easier
                to maneuver around. The high altitude can make this even more difficult if <br> you're not prepared, though
                you'll be able to encounter baboons, canyon views, <br> untouched valley towns, and emerald pools.
               </p>
               <h3>4. Walking and Trekking</h3>
               <p>
                Perhaps a more light-hearted alternative to the former activity, walking and trekking is <br> perfect in the
                Ethiopian highlands. Beautiful mountainous terrain and a temperate climate <br> make it a viable option for
                most travelers. The most popular areas for trekking are the <br> Simien and Bale Mountain National Parks, though
                the highlands both east and west of <br> the Omo valley will feature a stunning combination of views, animals 
                and flora.
               </p>
               <p>
                The vineyards of Ambo are also a great option and perfect for taking photos to commemorate <br> your trip. However,
                if you really want to get the blood flowing, the Simien Mountains are <br> there waiting for you. You'll obviously be 
                able to experience the high-altitude views, though <br> if you're lucky you'll also spot 3 endemic mammals: the Walia Ibex, 
                Gelada Baboon, and the <br> Simien Fox.
               </p>
               <h3>5. Swimming and Water Sports</h3>
               <p>
                While Ethiopia isn't generally overly hot, there are occasions where the sun may beam down <br> particularly hard on you. 
                For those days, you'll want to head to the lakes! Lake Langano and <br> Shalla are free of bilharzia, and you'll even be 
                able to soak in the natural springs in Awash <br> National Park or hot springs at SodereFilwoha!
               </p>
               <p>
                Taking out a boat on Lake Tana is quite common, and many local fishermen are friendly and <br> are more than happy to take 
                you on their own. If not, you can choose from a dugout canoe, <br> traditional papyrus boat, or even go windsurfing and 
                waterskiing! If you find yourself on the <br> Omo and Awash Rivers or the Blue Nile, things get more intense with white
                water rafting, <br> thanks to their countless canyons and waterfalls! Of course, you can always just hang out at <br> your 
                hotel pool, too.
               </p>
