                    Lake Tana is the largest lake in Ethiopia. It holds 50% of the country’s fresh <br>
                    water. It is also the source of the Blue Nile, which contributes up to 60% of <br>
                    the Nile’s water. Not only is the lake important as a water source for over 123 <br>
                    million people in the Nile Basin, it is also a source of food in the form of fish. <br>

                    the top 250 lake regions of Global Importance for Biodiversity. It has 28 species <br>
                    of fish, of which 21 are endemic. Commercially, the lake’s most important fishes <br>
                    include the large African barbs, Nile tilapia and African catfish. The annual <br>
